This application is a web-service that receives http get url like http://host:8080/hello/contacts?nameFilter=<filter>
and sends contacts which names don`t match to filter in JSON format.

In order to use the application with your db, please add appropriate jdbc driver (via pom.xml or add to library),
 and change configuration.properties file.

In order to test the application with Vagrant environment please follow next steps:
1. install Vagrant on your machine.
2. download vagrant box file and Vagrantfile(configuration file) from link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_qadqIssrPQbDFWUTFROGpPMEU
3. add box to vagrant with command line: vagrant box add contacts file:<path to downloaded box file>
4. use downloaded Vagrantfile as configuration:
   1) On Windows environment place it to C:\Users\<User>
   2) Or you can enter from comand line: vagrant init
	  This will create a file called Vagrantfile. In this file please uncomment and modify line: config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8080, host: 8080

5. launch vagrant with command line: vagrant up.
6. in order to connect to vagrant VM:
   1. If you use Windows, you must use git bash, or Cygwin. Please install what you prefer.
      (It is presumed you would install git bash). From git bash command line enter:
      ssh -i C:/Users/<your user name>/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key vagrant@127.0.0.1 -p 2222
   2. If you use Linux, enter from command line: vagrant ssh.
7. from git bash comand line enter: ./startApp.sh

    That`s all. The application is started and uses Postgres database.
    You can perform Http requests from your local browser.
    For example from Google Chrome insert url: http://localhost:8080/hello/contacts?nameFilter=^.*[aei].*$
    This action will obtain all contacts in JSON format, that do not match to '^.*[aei].*$' regular expression.
